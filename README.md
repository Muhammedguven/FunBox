<h1>Vision Statement</h1>
<p>Today, we spend a lot of time while watching movies, series or playing games. Firstly, there are a lot of platform for watching movies in the cinema, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Puhu Tv, Gain, Blu Tv, Exxen or illegal websites. In this case, the problem is that people cannot save all watched movies in one platform. The same problem exists for watched series and played games. FunBox comes into play at this point. Thanks to FunBox, People can store all watched movies, series and played games in cloud. They can give rates, add images and descriptions. For example, a user watched a movie with his friends, he can use FunBox, take a photo with his friends, give a rate to movie, and add his opinion idea about the movie. In next times, he can check out the app then remember that day and the movie. Moreover, when someone asks him to recommend a movie, he can see the movies which are liked the most by himself. This example can be adapted for series and games. </p>
<p> FunBox will be commercial if available on Google PlayStore through paid membership. We believe that FunBox will improve the quality of human life. Also, we think archiving movies, series or games is a fun activity.</p>
<p>People can use taking notes applications which are available on Google Play Store or App Store instead of FunBox but FunBoxâ€™s main purpose is that storage these activities with details. Also, FunBox is more user friendly and well-designed than taking notes applications. In our research, we saw there is not an application include same features as Funbox. </p>
